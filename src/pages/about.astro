        <h2>The Kid Who Felt Built Wrong</h2>
        <p>
          I grew up feeling disconnected. Like I was watching life through a window instead of living it. School didn't fit. The system didn't fit. I wasn't great at following instructions. I was better at finding my own way, even when that way was messy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Music became my first real identity. I went all-in on EDM production and DJing for seven years. I played real stages and clubs, built a following, lived the life. From the outside, it looked like I'd made it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here's what nobody talks about: you can achieve things and still feel alone inside the wins. I was surrounded by people but not really connected to any of them. The crowds cheered, but I was still that kid watching through the window.
        </p>

        <h2>The Floor</h2>
        <p>
          At 27, the music dream ended. Not with a bang, with a sputter. I burned out, ran out of money, and found myself back at my mom's house with nothing to show for seven years of grinding.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I drove Uber. I scraped together freelance gigs. I took any work I could find while trying to figure out what came next.
        </p>
        <p>
          That "figuring out" turned into SEO consulting. Within a year, I went from broke to making $10K/month. Today, I'm a Top Rated Plus freelancer on Upwork with a 100% job success rate, top 1% of SEO experts globally. My agency has helped generate over $100M in revenue for clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't get lucky. I figured it out from the floor.
        </p>

        <h2>The Nomad Trap</h2>
        <p>
          Once the money started flowing, I did what every burned-out millennial dreams of: I traveled. 45+ countries. Cool backdrops. Instagram moments. Total freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          But freedom without roots starts to feel like floating. You're everywhere and nowhere. You have a thousand acquaintances and zero real friends. The cool places start to blur together because you're experiencing them alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's when it finally clicked: the best part of life isn't the cool places or the cool things. It's who you do them with.
        </p>

        <h2>Now</h2>
        <p>
          I'm in Mexico City. Not as a stop on the nomad circuit, as home. I'm putting down roots, building deep friendships, and creating things that matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I run an SEO agency. I'm building tools for people with ADHD brains (I have it too, it's a feature, not a bug). I read 50-100 books a year. I'm learning bachata, I box, I ski, I lift. I lost 100+ pounds and kept it off.
        </p>
        <p>
          My vibe these days? 80s rockstar with an edge. Mostly black, some animal print. Main character energy, but self-aware about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm building Wifi Rockstar for misfits whose brains don't fit factory settings. Because I know what it's like to feel built wrong for the system, and I know you can build your own instead.
        </p>

        <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Achievement doesn't equal connection.</strong> You can win and still feel alone.</li>
          <li><strong>Freedom needs roots.</strong> Floating isn't freedom, it's just being lost with good weather.</li>
          <li><strong>The people are the point.</strong> Everything else is just scenery.</li>
          <li><strong>You don't need to be fixed.</strong> You might just need systems that fit your brain.</li>
          <li><strong>Rock bottom is a foundation.</strong> I figured it out from the floor. You can too.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
        <p>
          I'm always down to meet interesting people, especially fellow misfits building their own path. If something here resonated, reach out.
