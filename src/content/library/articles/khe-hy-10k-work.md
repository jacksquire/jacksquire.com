note: "Ran Khe's older course years ago and stayed in touch—Craft + Commerce brought us together again and there was even a Swedish House Mafia night in LA in the mix."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Plan every day by stacking 1% advantages rather than chasing dramatic launches."
  - "Design for people you respect; conversations are the best market research."
  - "Use creative constraints to stay sharp so you can serve the next 10,000 fans."

The 10K Work cycle is not a hype train; it is an atelier, routed through the lessons of years in music, design, and online business. Khe distills how to pace a creative practice so it scales without burning out—the course scripts rhythm into every habit, balancing whiteboard thinking with the kind of muscle memory that only shows up after shipping repetitively.

Because I first did the older run of this framework, the new version felt like visiting an old mentor. I left with notebooks full of tactical rituals, but what stuck is the attitude Khe models: talk less about the thing you're making and more about the people you wish to serve. Craft + Commerce became the living room for that philosophy, and reconnecting with Khe there (and later seeing Swedish House Mafia in LA with him) kept the lessons alive beyond the course room.

I bump this entry to S+ because every module challenges you to rebuild how you spend the next 10,000 hours: twice-weekly rituals, thoughtful outreach, and a focus on systems instead of hacks. If you're steering a creative business, it is the most generous hand-off to clarity I've experienced.
